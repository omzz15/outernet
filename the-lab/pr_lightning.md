## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want  to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.

> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!

Here's an example: 

* I want to talk about why tabs are better than spaces
* Show them the difference of tabs and spaces
* I'll give extreme and funny examples
* I will show code and use a clip from the internet
* I will have slides and need a projecter

.. and so forth (you can also write a full paragraph if you'd like).
