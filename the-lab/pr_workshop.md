## Workshop name

### Plan

> What do you want to run, and how do you think it'll be like? (can you give us a rough outline?)

> Are there any resources you think you might use? Have you run something like this before, or have an example (even if it's not related 100%)

#### Outline

For example:

1. Get people to open sprig.hackclub.com on their computers
2. Have them make a new project 
3. Show them some demo code, and helper functions (walk them through everything)
<br> .. and so forth

### Do you think you might need anything?

> Do you need hardware boards, or other supplies like paint that you would need us to purchase or have on hand? We won't have any projectors available.

_insert equipment here_

### People involved

> List all the people who are running this workshop if it's more than 1!

For example:

* Prophet Orpheus
* Arav Narula
